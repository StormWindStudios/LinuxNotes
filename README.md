# CompTIA Linux+ Notes
[Help! I'm at a Command Line and My Boss is Watching Me](/commandline.md)
## Installation Notes
### Installation Process
* RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora all use the Anaconda installer. Therefore, the installation process is very similar between them. [Here](https://www.tecmint.com/installation-of-rhel-8/) is a description of it. The Anaconda installer will create an anaconda-ks.cfg file in the **/root** directory. You can modify and use this for unattended installations!
* Ubuntu server uses a different installer, but you'll be making many of the same configurations. You can read more about it [here](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/install/step-by-step). 
* OpenSUSE uses a installation tool called YaST ("Yet Another Setup Tool"). Again, it looks different, but performs many of the same functions. Documentation [here](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/startup/html/book-opensuse-startup/art-opensuse-installquick.html).

### Partitioning and Filesystem
* Partitions divide disks into one or more segments
* Partitioning information can be tracked with MBR or GPT
    * **MBR** - Master Boot Record. Limited to 2TB disks and 4 primary partitions. *Legacy*.
    * **GPT** - GUID Partition Table. Supports huge disks and up to 128 partitions. *Preferred*.
* Each partition can be formatted with a unique filesystem
* Common Linux filesystems are:
    * XFS
    * ext3
    * ext4
* Different distributions may favor certain filesystems by default. For instance, Red Hat operating systems often favor XFS.
* In Windows, each partition is usually given a unique drive letter (e.g., C:, E:, Z:...)
* In Linux, there is a single **root** filesystem which may contain many mounted partitions. For instance, examine the output of the `lsblk` below. This command lists block storage devices and their mount points.

```
shane@ubuntu:~$ lsblk
sda                         8:0    0   16G  0 disk 
├─sda1                      8:1    0    1M  0 part 
├─sda2                      8:2    0    1G  0 part /boot
└─sda3                      8:3    0   15G  0 part 
  └─ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 253:0    0   15G  0 lvm  /
```

Notice that the **root** filesytem (**/**) is on the sda3 partition. However, the sda2 partition is mounted to the **/boot** directory within the root filesystem.

Listing the contents of **/**, **/boot** is treated as a typical directory, even though it's a different filesystem  (and might not even be on the same disk!).

```
shane@ubuntu:~$ ls /
bin    dev   lib    libx32      mnt   root  snap      sys  var
boot   etc   lib32  lost+found  opt   run   srv       tmp
cdrom  home  lib64  media       proc  sbin  swap.img  usr
```

### LVM (Logical Volume Management)
In the installations we demonstrate during class, we installed Linux using LVM. This is usually a good idea because it abstracts away the physical partitioning and gives us flexibility as system administrators.

In a nutshell, LVM consists of a set of physical volumes (PVs) grouped together into a volume group (VG). In a VG, we can create logical volumes (LVs) to meet our needs. 

Consider the 3-disk setup below. We use each disk as a physical volume, group them into a single volume group, and then do something interesting when defining the logical volumes-- the first logical volume spans two disks!

```
 ________    ________    ________ 
|        |  |        |  |        |
| Disk 1 |  | Disk 2 |  | Disk 3 | 
|________|  |________|  |________|

|   PV   |  |   PV   |  |   PV   |

|           Volume Group         |

|    Logical Volume  |  |   LV   |

```

## Package Management

One of the most important differences between different distributions of Linux is the package managers they use. There are two "main" flavors of Linux: **RHEL** flavors and **Debian** flavors.

RHEL distributions use **.rpm** packages. Examples include:
* CentOS 
* Fedora
* RHEL 
* OpenSUSE

Debian distributions use **.deb** packages. Examples include:
* Ubuntu
* Linux Mint
* Debian
* Raspbian

Both flavors give us the ability to manage individual packages, but it is usually easier to use dependency-aware tools such as yum/dnf, zypper, or apt.

| Flavor | Manage Individual Packages | Manage Packages & Dependencies |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------------
| Red Hat (excluding OpenSUSE) | rpm | yum or dnf|
| OpenSUSE | rpm | zypper |
| Debian | dpkg | apt |

### Red Hat Package Management
*Note:* on RHEL, you should first configure your subscription using `sudo subscription-manager register --username YOUR_USERNAME --password YOUR_PASSWORD --auto-attach`

## Booting
A series of actions are performed to get a system up and running. It is important to distinguish the boot process used by legacy BIOS systems from the one that occurs on UEFI systems.
### BIOS Boot Process
1. The BIOS performs the power-on self test (POST), making sure that all the components are functioning properly.
2. If POST succeeds, the BIOS locates the MBR and loads a tiny "first-stage" bootloader from it. This is *very* limited in size; in practice, it points to a more capable bootloader on another partition.
3. On Linux systems, the first-stage bootloader usually loads GRUB (the GRand Unified Bootloader) from the **/boot** partition.
4. GRUB then loads the Linux kernel.
5. The first process spawned is usually *systemd*, which manages the remainder of the startup process.

The output of `lsblk` below show the **/boot** partition. This contains GRUB, and is what the first-stage bootloader in the MBR "points to."
```
shane@ubuntu:~$ lsblk
sda                         8:0    0   16G  0 disk 
├─sda1                      8:1    0    1M  0 part 
├─sda2                      8:2    0    1G  0 part /boot
└─sda3                      8:3    0   15G  0 part 
  └─ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 253:0    0   15G  0 lvm  /
```

The **/boot** directory on a BIOS system, containing the kernels (vmlinuz), and GRUB files.
```
shane@ubuntu:~$ ls /boot
config-5.4.0-66-generic      lost+found
grub                         System.map-5.4.0-66-generic
initrd.img                   vmlinuz
initrd.img-5.4.0-66-generic  vmlinuz-5.4.0-66-generic
initrd.img.old               vmlinuz.old
```
### UEFI Boot Process
1. The UEFI performs the power-on self test (POST), making sure that all the components are functioning properly.
2. If POST succeeds, the UEFI finds the EFI system partition (ESP) and loads a *.efi* bootloader. GRUB is optional for UEFI systems, but it's still commonly used.
3. The bootloader then loads the Linux kernel.
4. As usual, *systemd* takes over from there.

The output of `lsblk` is a bit different on EFI systems. In addition to the **/boot** partition, there's a dedicated **/boot/efi** partition, which the UEFI can find directly. 
```
shane@ubuntu-efi:~$ lsblk
sda                         8:0    0   10G  0 disk 
├─sda1                      8:1    0  512M  0 part /boot/efi
├─sda2                      8:2    0    1G  0 part /boot
└─sda3                      8:3    0  8.5G  0 part 
  └─ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 253:0    0  8.5G  0 lvm  /
```

The EFI files on an Ubuntu system. Again, the UEFI can load *grubx64.efi* directly.
```
shane@ubuntu-efi:~$ ls /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/
BOOTX64.CSV  grub.cfg  grubx64.efi  mmx64.efi  shimx64.efi
```

The EFI bootloader (such as grubx64.efi) will then load the kernel from **/boot**:

```
shane@ubuntu-efi:~$ ls /boot/
config-5.4.0-66-generic  initrd.img-5.4.0-66-generic  vmlinuz
efi                      initrd.img.old               vmlinuz-5.4.0-66-generic
grub                     lost+found                   vmlinuz.old
initrd.img               System.map-5.4.0-66-generic
```
You can read more about the boot process [here](https://linuxhint.com/understanding_boot_process_bios_uefi/).

### Configuration
Several common GRUB configurations are made in `/etc/default/grub`. 

Using the `head` command, we can print out the first 8 lines (and the most frequently changed configurations).
```
head -n 8 /etc/default/grub
# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update
# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.
# For full documentation of the options in this file, see:
#   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'

GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
```
* GRUB_DEFAULT specifies the default kernel that will be loaded without user intervention
* GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE changes how (and if) the GRUB menu is displayed during boot. 
    * hidden - the menu won't be displayed unless ESC is pressed
    * menu - the menu will be displayed during the countdown
* GRUB_TIMEOUT sets the time (in seconds) GRUB waits before loading the default kernel. A value of 0 causes it to boot immediately.

After making changes to `/etc/default/grub` on a RHEL system, run `sudo grub2-mkconfig` for them to take effect. By default, `grub2-mkconfig` just outputs the configuration to the command line. You must specify where to save it using the `-o` flag.
* BIOS: `sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`
* UEFI: `sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg`

```
[shane@rhel ~]$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Generating grub configuration file ...
done
```

After making changes to `/etc/default/grub` on an Ubuntu system, run `sudo update-grub` for them to take effect.
```
shane@ubuntu-efi:~$ sudo update-grub
Sourcing file `/etc/default/grub'
Sourcing file `/etc/default/grub.d/init-select.cfg'
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-66-generic
Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-66-generic
Adding boot menu entry for UEFI Firmware Settings
done
```

### What's this vmlinuz and initrd nonsense?

* **vmlinuz** files are the Linux kernel images themselves. They usually end in a "z" to indicate that they are compressed.

* **initrd** files are the "inital ramdisks." They provide a minimal root filesystem which the kernel can use to load core drivers/modules before mounting the actual filesystems on disk partitions.

### Grubby!

The `grubby` command can be used to view and update GRUB configurations on supported systems (usually Red Hat flavors).

**View the default kernel with `grubby`**
```
[shane@rhel ~]$ sudo grubby --default-kernel
/boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-240.15.1.el8_3.x86_64
```

**View info about current kernel and its boot parameters with `grubby`**
```
[shane@rhel ~]$ sudo grubby --info=/boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)
index=0
kernel="/boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-240.15.1.el8_3.x86_64"
args="ro crashkernel=auto resume=/dev/mapper/rhel-swap rd.lvm.lv=rhel/root rd.lvm.lv=rhel/swap rhgb quiet $tuned_params"
root="/dev/mapper/rhel-root"
initrd="/boot/initramfs-4.18.0-240.15.1.el8_3.x86_64.img $tuned_initrd"
title="Red Hat Enterprise Linux (4.18.0-240.15.1.el8_3.x86_64) 8.3 (Ootpa)"
id="fba36d7225b7455cb8f59f49a23499c7-4.18.0-240.15.1.el8_3.x86_64"
```
Note: *the `$(uname -r)` is called a command substitution. It provides the output of the `uname -r` command as part of the command we're issuing. `uname -r` prints the running kernel version (4.18.0-240.15.1.el8_3.x86_64), and is much easier to type!*

**Remove a boot argument (in this case, "quiet") from a kernel with `grubby`.** 

Removing the `quiet` argument will cause verbose output to be display during boot.
```
[shane@rhel ~]$ sudo grubby --remove-args "quiet" --update-kernel="/boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)"
[shane@rhel ~]$ sudo grubby --info=/boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)
---snip---
root rd.lvm.lv=rhel/swap rhgb $tuned_params"
---snip---
```

### Ad-Hoc GRUB Configurations
Sometimes, you need to change the GRUB configuration during boot because something broke. To do so, when the GRUB menu appears (you may need to hold `shift` to make it appear), you can select the entry you want to modify and type `e`. 

From there, you can edit the text of the boot entry as needed. What would an example of an edit be? Well, imagine you have a GUI installed, and you're unable to boot into the graphical interface. To perform maintenance and troubleshooting, you could append `systemd.unit=multi-user.target` to the kernel line to boot only into a CLI.

To boot with the changes, press `Ctrl+X`. These changes are non-persistent, so if something breaks you can usually fix it by rebooting.


### So Can Anyone Just Make These Ad Hoc Configurations?
Yes, by default. Which isn't great. It isn't difficult to set a GRUB password, though.

Note: *these configurations will have different behaviors. The Red Hat example will only prompt for credentials if users try to modify boot arguments. The Ubuntu example requires credentials for any booting to occur!*

**On Red Hat distributions**

Use the `grub2-setpassword` command. Don't forget to run `grub2-mkconfig` to updates the configurations.
```
[shane@rhel ~]$ sudo grub2-setpassword
Enter password: 
Confirm password: 
[shane@rhel ~]$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Generating grub configuration file ...
done
```

**On Debian distributions**

 You can manually place a password hash in `/etc/grub.d` and run `update-grub`.**

1. Create password hash using `grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2`
```
shane@ubuntu:~$ grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: 
Reenter password: 
PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.90E586E3533AD8B944FB411C5A50CDD1AC0974295B2B25ADE165564677B8B138B0CCA0875D8202C89DBF9BE7E46DB02CE4484651BDCF708100E25796F3541C6D.C4D98F83F5A710087DD4D4879A311B00F732DA41D752047C26E6EE03CA1892F825FF8FE1AE989E796F95229C579071E5A23916611067620D1B023BA573463775
```

2. Using nano or vim, set a superuser name and password in `/etc/grub.d/40_custom`. The first line is `set superusers="username"`and the second is `password_pbkdf2 username grub.pbkdf2.sha512...`
```
exec tail -n +3 $0
# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the
# menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change
# the 'exec tail' line above.
set superusers="shane"
password_pbkdf2 shane grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.90E586E3533AD8B944FB411C5A50CDD1AC0974295B2B25ADE165564677B8B138B0CCA0875D8202C89DBF9BE7E46DB02CE4484651BDCF708100E25796F3541C6D.C4D98F83F5A710087DD4D4879A311B00F732DA41D752047C26E6EE03CA1892F825FF8FE1AE989E796F95229C579071E5A23916611067620D1B023BA573463775                  
```

3. Finally, run `sudo update-grub`. Your Ubuntu system now has GRUB password-protected. 

**Yes-- it's a lot easier on Red Hat flavors!**
