## CompTIA Linux+ Notes
### Package Management

One of the most important differences between different distributions of Linux is the package managers they use. There are two "main" flavors of Linux: **RHEL** flavors and **Debian** flavors.

RHEL distributions use **.rpm** packages. Examples include:
* CentOS 
* Fedora
* RHEL 
* OpenSUSE

Debian distributions use **.deb** packages. Examples include:
* Ubuntu
* Linux Mint
* Debian
* Raspbian

| Flavor | Manage Individual Packages | Manage Packages & Dependencies |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------------
| Red Hat (excluding OpenSUSE) | rpm | yum or dnf|
| OpenSUSE | rpm | zypper |
| Debian | dpkg | apt
